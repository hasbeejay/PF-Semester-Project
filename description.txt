The Automobile Management System simulates a variety of operations related to managing a car dealership. 
	It allows users to interact with the system through a console-based menu to carry out car 
	sales, purchases, modifications, and inspections. It saves records in text files for future reference 
	and provides a unique ticketing system for each transaction or service request.
